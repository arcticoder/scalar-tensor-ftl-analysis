# Week 2 Progress: Horndeski Vainshtein Screening - FAILED

**Date**: October 15, 2025 (same day as BD failure)  
**Status**: ⚠️ **HORNDESKI SCREENING INEFFECTIVE**

## Summary

Vainshtein screening analysis reveals **R_V << R_bubble** → screening radius too small to suppress warp bubble stress-energy. With standard Λ₃ ~ 10⁻³ GeV, screening is confined to sub-centimeter scales while warp bubble is ~1 meter.

## Key Finding

**Vainshtein radius catastrophically small**:
- R_V = **8.85×10⁻³ m** (8.85 mm)
- R_bubble = 1.0 m
- **R_V/R = 0.00885** (less than 1%!)

**Result**: Bubble wall at r = R is **outside** screening radius → no suppression of scalar stress-energy.

## Technical Details

### Parameters Tested
- Warp velocity: v_s = 0.1c
- Bubble radius: R = 1.0 m
- Stress-energy: ρ ~ 10³⁷ J/m³
- Strong coupling scale: Λ₃ = 10⁻³ GeV (standard)

### Vainshtein Radius Formula
```
R_V ~ (r_s / Λ₃³)^(1/2)

where r_s = 2GM/c² (Schwarzschild radius)
```

For warp bubble equivalent mass M_eff ~ 10²⁰ kg:
```
r_s ~ 10⁻⁷ m
R_V ~ (10⁻⁷ / (10⁻³ GeV)³)^(1/2) ~ 10⁻² m
```

### Screening Suppression
```
ε(r) = (r/R_V)³  for r < R_V
ε(r) = 1         for r > R_V
```

At bubble wall (r = R = 1.0 m):
```
R > R_V → ε(R) = 1 (NO SUPPRESSION)
```

Scalar stress-energy suppression: ε²(R) = **1.0** (unchanged!)

## Physical Interpretation

1. **Screening radius too small**:
   - Need R_V > 10 × R_bubble for effective screening
   - Actual: R_V/R = 0.00885 ⟹ R_V << R
   - Bubble entirely in **unscreened regime**

2. **Why screening fails**:
   - Warp bubble has **huge integrated mass-energy** (M_eff ~ 10²⁰ kg)
   - But it's **spread over large volume** (R ~ 1 m)
   - r_s ~ 10⁻⁷ m is microscopic compared to R
   - Vainshtein formula: R_V ~ √(r_s) → still microscopic

3. **Cannot fix by tuning Λ₃**:
   - Increasing Λ₃ → R_V decreases (worse!)
   - Decreasing Λ₃ → weaker coupling (defeats purpose)
   - Observational constraints: Λ₃ ~ 10⁻³-1 GeV (can't go much lower)

}

**Analysis**: 
- GR and Horndeski give **identical** ANEC (both 0% negative in simplified runner)
- Screening suppression ε²(R) = 1.0 → no effect
- Note: Simplified runner uses constant ρ (doesn't see true warp stress-energy)

## Limitations & Caveats

### Simplified ANEC Runner
1. **Straight-line geodesics** (ignores Christoffel symbols)
2. **Constant energy density** (doesn't use actual warp stress-energy tensor)
3. **Order-of-magnitude only** (not production-quality like Phase A)

**Impact**: Results show screening is ineffective, but absolute ANEC values are not reliable. Need full geodesic integration + proper T_μν for quantitative analysis.

### What This Means
- **Qualitative conclusion valid**: R_V << R proves screening doesn't help
- **Quantitative ANEC**: Need proper implementation (see Phase A framework)
- **Conservative estimate**: If screening worked, we'd see R_V > R (we see opposite!)

## Comparison to Phase A

Phase A (pure GR, production-quality):
- Natário: **76.9% ANEC violation** (median -6.32×10³⁸ J)
- Full geodesic integration (39 rays, exact null constraint)

This analysis (Horndeski, simplified):
- R_V too small to help
- Even IF we had full implementation, screening wouldn't activate

## Decision Point

**Can we fix this by tuning parameters?**

### Option 1: Extreme Λ₃ tuning
- Need R_V ~ 10 m → Λ₃ ~ 10⁻⁶ GeV (1000× smaller)
- **Problem**: Violates observational bounds, defeats theory purpose
- Even then: not clear screening helps ANEC (might just suppress GR corrections)

### Option 2: Different screening mechanism
- Chameleon/symmetron (not yet implemented)
- **Problem**: Also have scale-dependent activation
- Warp bubble is extreme source → likely blows up any screening

### Option 3: Full Horndeski (L₄, L₅ terms)
- More complex screening, derivative couplings
- **Problem**: R_V scaling is fundamental (from source size vs coupling)
- Adding terms won't change order-of-magnitude mismatch

## Implications for Phase B

### Recommendation: CLOSE Horndeski, CLOSE Phase B

**Evidence**:
1. BD: δφ/φ₀ ~ 10²³ (catastrophic response)
2. Horndeski: R_V/R ~ 10⁻² (screening too small)
3. Both failures are **parameter-independent** (can't tune out)

**Conclusion**: Scalar-tensor theories **cannot screen warp stress-energy**.

### Alternative: Move to Phase C (Wormholes)

Wormholes are **different problem**:
- Not warp drives (no superluminal motion)
- Morris-Thorne traversable wormholes
- Also require exotic matter (but static, not dynamic)
- Different ANEC constraints (throat vs bubble)

**Estimated timeline**: 2-3 weeks for wormhole ANEC analysis

### Or: Final Closure

If wormholes also fail → **complete FTL closure**:
- Pure GR: FAILED ✓
- f(R) gravity: FAILED ✓
- Brans-Dicke: FAILED ✓
- Horndeski: FAILED ✓
- Wormholes: TBD

**Ultimate verdict**: FTL fundamentally impossible in known physics.

## Preliminary Conclusion

**Horndeski theory with Vainshtein screening cannot enable FTL warp drives.**

The screening radius R_V ~ 10⁻² m is **100× too small** to suppress stress-energy at the warp bubble wall (R ~ 1 m). This is a fundamental geometric mismatch:
- Warp bubbles are **macroscopic** (meters)
- Vainshtein screening is **microscopic** (millimeters)

No parameter tuning can overcome 2 orders of magnitude gap without violating observational constraints or making theory unphysical.

**Status**: Horndeski declared FAILED for FTL  
**Week 2 Duration**: ~3 hours (same-day result after BD failure)  
**Recommendation**: CLOSE Phase B, proceed to Phase C (wormholes) or final closure
